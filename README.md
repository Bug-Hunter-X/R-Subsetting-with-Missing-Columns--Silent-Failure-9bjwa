# R Subsetting with Missing Columns: Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue in R: when subsetting data frames using character vectors, R silently drops columns that do not exist. This can lead to incorrect results without any warning or error message.

The `bug.R` file contains code that reproduces the problem. The `bugSolution.R` file provides a solution using more robust subsetting techniques.

This is a frequent source of errors, especially in larger projects or when working with data that may be incomplete or inconsistent.
